\section{Cost-push shock in NK model w/o and w/ learning - Intuition}

Same clarification (based on Justiniano \& Primiceri's Bank of Belgium presentation 2010):
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{efficient output}: output under flexible prices and no distortions
\item \underline{potential output}: output under flexible prices but imperfect competition, yet constant markups
\item \underline{natural output}: output under flexible prices but imperfect competition AND nominal frictions (time-varying markups)
\end{itemize}
$\rightarrow$ Eric Sims: ``2 distortions in the NK model: LR distortion (imperfect competition) and SR distortion (price rigidity).''
I think:
\begin{enumerate}
\item In st.st, potential output = natural output. 
\item In an NK model, mon. policy stabilizes actual output to potential output (= st.st. natural output). In other words, mon. pol can't undo a LR distortion because money is neutral in the LR.
\end{enumerate}
A cost-push shock:
\begin{itemize}
\item is a shock to the steady-state markup $\mu$: $\mu = \frac{\theta}{\theta-1}$, where $\theta =$ el. of substitution between varieties $\rightarrow$ it's a shock to the level of LR distortions (to the distance to perfect competition).
\item Note that a cost-push shock isn't the only thing that can move markups in the NK model: out of st.st., marginal costs are an increasing function of demand (and thus of output gaps), and so demand shocks increase marginal costs, decreasing markups.
\item I think it is for this reason that Clarida, Gali \& Gertler (1999) call cost-push shocks ``all shocks that are not demand that move markups.''
\end{itemize}
Why think about cost-push shocks? $\rightarrow$ because they are the only shock that introduces an inflation-output gap tradeoff for the mon. authority. Key point: I think that this tradeoff is amplified is expectations are allowed to move around. That is, I think one can make a case for anchoring expectations here. I'm going to lay out the argument in three steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clarida, Gali \& Gertler (1999)'s Result 1: for mon. policy w/o commitment, cost-push shocks introduce an inflation-output gap tradeoff in a NK model. If expectations are allowed to adjust, the tradeoff is amplified.
\item Let's see the same intuition on the plain-vanilla 3-equation NK model w/ commitment (a Taylor rule). f expectations are allowed to adjust, the tradeoff is amplified.
\item Let's look at the CEMP economy: we can see the same intuition at work as in the 3-equation NK model.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Clarida, Gali \& Gertler (1999)'s Result 1}
The CB's problem is the standard mon. policy problem under discretion:
\begin{align}
\max -\frac{1}{2}(\alpha x_t^2 + \pi_t^2 ) + F_t \quad \text{s.t} \quad \pi_t = \lambda x_t + f_t
\end{align}
where expectations $F_t$ and $f_t = \beta \E \pi_{t+1} + u_t$ are taken as given by the CB, and $u_t$ is a cost-push shock (appended to the NKPC). Optimality conditions to this problem, subbing $f_t$ in, are:
\begin{align}
x_t = -\frac{\lambda}{\alpha + \lambda^2}(\beta \E \pi_{t+1} + u_t) \\
\pi_t = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \lambda^2}(\beta \E \pi_{t+1} + u_t) 
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
\item A favorable cost-push shock ($\theta  \uparrow, u_t \downarrow$, that is we move towards perfect competition) $\rightarrow x_t \uparrow, \pi_t \downarrow$.
\item If $\E \pi_{t+1}$ is allowed to move (unanchored), it will decrease over time, amplifying the shock. (I'm implicitly assuming RLS learning for the expectation formation.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The 3-equation NK model}
\begin{align}
\pi_t & = \beta \E_t\pi_{t+1} + \kappa x_t  + u_t\\
x_t & = \E_t x_{t+1} -\frac{1}{\sigma} (i_t - \E_t\pi_{t+1}) + \frac{1}{\sigma}r_t^n \\
i_t & = \delta_{\pi} \pi_t + \delta_x x_t
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
\item $u_t \downarrow \rightarrow \pi_t \downarrow$ (my intuition tells me that $x_t$ should go up because less market power means higher quantities, lower prices, but I fail to see it here).
\item If mon policy reacts, as the TR tells it to, it lowers interest rates, leading to a rise in output gaps. Voila. 
\item Again, if expectations are allowed to move, assuming RLS learning, $\E\pi_{t+1} \downarrow$, pushing inflation down further, amplifying the shock. 
\item Although expectations moving also helps you a bit, because it balances some of the increase in $x_t$. (?)
\end{itemize}

	
\subsection{CEMP (w/o specified mon. policy)}
\begin{align}
k_t & = \mathbf{f_k} \\
\bar{\pi}_t &=\mathbf{f_{\bar{\pi}}} + \mathbf{f_k}^{-1}\eta_{t-1}\\
\xi_t & = \mathbf{f_{\xi}} + \mathbf{A_{\xi}} \xi_{t-1} + S_{\xi} \begin{pmatrix} \epsilon_t \\ \mu_t \end{pmatrix} 
\end{align}
where $\xi = (\eta, \varphi, \pi)'$, and $\pi$ is described by a hybrid Phillips-curve with marginal cost shocks (shock $\epsilon$ on $\varphi$) and markup shocks $\mu_t$, and $\eta_t = \mu_t + \epsilon_t$, i.e. it's a catch-all shock which mixes marginal cost and markup shocks $\rightarrow$ marginal cost shocks stand in for demand shocks (which is absent in the model), and $\mu_t$ is the cost-push shock. (Here a demand shock will have the same effect as a cost-push shock... mmm, I don't know if I like that...)
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu_t \downarrow \rightarrow \eta_t \downarrow$
\item $\pi_t \downarrow$
\item If beliefs anchored, $\mathbf{f_k}^{-1} \rightarrow 0$, i.e. beliefs aren't allowed to fluctuate, so we stop here.
\item If unanchored, $\bar{\pi}_t \downarrow \rightarrow \pi_t \downarrow \dots$ Again, shock is amplified. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why is the discretion and 3-equation intuition not quite the same? Does ignoring beliefs make their amplification role more acute?
\item Demand shocks? $\rightarrow$ it seems to me to be a general thing that expectations (if based on RLS learning) amplify shocks, making stabilization more costly. But cost-push shocks seem special because of the tradeoff they introduce. 
\item Cost-push shocks as supply shocks? The issue of stabilization when shocks permanent (new steady state).
\end{itemize}


\section{A problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item Eusepi \& Preston (2018, JEL): reevaluates optimal mon. pol in the NK model through the lens of learning. Bam. 
\begin{itemize}
\item In particular: Result 5B. New tradeoff due to learning: policy today needs to respond more aggressively to inflation in order to limit future movements in expectations that would make the short-run tradeoff worse. 
\item Result 6. Divine coincidence doesn't hold, even in the absence of cost-push shocks. (apparently already shown in Eusepi, Giannoni \& Preston (2015))
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
